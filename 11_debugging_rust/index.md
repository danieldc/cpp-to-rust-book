# Debugging Rust

Rust compiles into machine code the same as C and benefits from sharing the same ABI and compiler backend formats as C/C++.

So you can debug Rust in the same way as C/C++. If you built your Rust executable in a gcc compatible binary format you can just invoke gdb on it:

```
gdb my_executable
```

Rust comes with a gdb wrapper script called `rust-gdb` that loads macros which perform syntax highlighting.

## Enabling backtrace

If your code is crashing because of a panic!\(\) you can get a backtrace on the console by setting the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable.

```
# Windows
set RUST_BACKTRACE=1
# Unix/Linux
export RUST_BACKTRACE=1
```

## Find out your target binary format

If you are in doubt what you are targeting, you may use `rustup` to show you.

```
c:\dev\visu>rustup show
Default host: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (default)
rustc 1.13.0 (2c6933acc 2016-11-07)
```

Or perhaps:

```
[foo@localhost ~]$ rustup show
Default host: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)
rustc 1.13.0 (2c6933acc 2016-11-07)
```

The information will tell you which debugger you can use to debug your code.

### Microsoft Visual Studio

If you have the MSVC toolchain \(32 or 64-bit\) or the LLVM backend will generate a .pdb file and binaries will be compatible with the standard MSVC runtime.

To debug your code:

1. Open Visual Studio
2. Choose File \| Open \| Project/Solution...
3. Select the compiled executable
4. Open a source file to debug and set a breakpoint
5. Click the "Start" button

### GDB

GDB can be invoked directly from the command line or through a plugin / IDE. From the command line it's a

### LLDB
