# Virtual Destructors

C++ allows classes to inherit from other classes.

In some cases, such as this example, this can lead to memory leaks:

```c++
class ABase {
public:
  ~ABase() {}
};

class A : public ABase {
  std::string *value_;
public:
  A() : value_(new std::string) {}
  ~A() { delete value_; }
};

void do_something() {
  ABase *instance = new A();
  //...
  delete instance;
}
```

So here we allocate a pointer to A, assign it to "instance" which is of type `ABase`, do something with it and finally delete it. It looks fine but we just leaked memory! When we called "delete instance" the code invoked the destructor `~ABase()` and NOT the destructor `~A()` . And `value_` was not deleted and the memory leaked. Even if we'd used a scoped pointer to wrap `value_` it would still have leaked.

The code should have said

```c++
class ABase {
public:
  virtual ~ABase() {}
};
```

The compiler didn't care our code was in error. It just allowed us to leak for the sake of a missing keyword.

## How Rust helps

Rust also does not use inheritance so problems like ABase above cannot exist. In Rust `ABase` would be declared as a trait that A implements.

```rust
trait ABase {
  //...
}

struct A {
  value: String,
}

impl ABase for A {
  //...
}
```

Rust also allows our struct to implement another trait called `Drop` which is equivalent to a C++ destructor.

```rust
impl Drop for A {
  fn drop(&mut self) {
    println!("A has been dropped!");
  }
}
```

It allows our code to do something during destruction such as to free an open resource, log a message or whatever.
