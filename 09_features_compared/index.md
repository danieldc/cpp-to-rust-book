# Features of Rust compared with C++

Rust and C++ are compiled languages with support for the following.

* Variables
* Expressions
* Structures and types
* Enums
* Memory allocation
* Strings
* Collections
* Threads
* Error handling

In some cases these are done in an analogous or similar fashion, in others they are very different.

In some cases, C++ is the victim of circumstances. For example  Unicode and encodings like UTF-8 are relatively recent compared to the language  so support was retrofitted into the string types and can feel a little clunky. Whereas Rust was able to benefit from an elegant choice from the get go.
