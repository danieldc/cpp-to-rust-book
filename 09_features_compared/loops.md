# Loops

## C++

### For loops

A `for` loop in C/C++ consists of 3 expression sections housed in the `for()` section and a block of code to execute:

The three segments of a for statement allow:

* Zero or more variables to be initialized \(can be empty\)
* Zero or more conditions to be true for the loop to continue \(can be empty\)
* Zero or more actions to perform on each iteration \(can be empty\).

So this is a valid for loop:

```cpp
// Infinite
for (;;) {
  //...
}
```

So is this:

```cpp
for (int i = 10, j = 0; (j = i * i) <= 100; i--) {
  //...
}
```

This is clearly a convoluted and somewhat confusing loop because it mixes assignment and conditional tests into the terminating text, but it is one which is entirely legal.

#### Iterating a range

A C++ loop consists of an initialising expression, a condition expression and a a loop expression separated by semicolons. So a loop that iterates from 0 to 100 looks like this:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
  cout << "Number " << i << endl;
}
```

#### Iterating C++ collections

C++ introduces the concept of iterators to its collection classes. An `iterator` is something that can increment or decrement to traverse a collection.

So to iterate a collection from one end to the other, an iterator is assigned with the collection's `begin()` iterator and incremented until it matches the `end()` iterator.

```cpp
for (std::vector<string>::const_iterator i = my_list.begin(); i != my_list.end(); ++i ) {
  cout << "Value = " << *i << end;
}
```

C++11 provides new range based for-loop with simpler syntax when iterating over arrays and collections:

```cpp
std::vector values;
...
for (const auto & v: values) {
  ...
}

int x[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
for (int y : x) {
  ...
}
```

### Infinite Loop

An infinite loop is one that never ends. The typical way to do this in C++ is to test against an expression that always evaluates to true or use an empty for loop:

```cpp
while (true) {
  poll();
  do_work();
}
// Or with a for loop
for (;;) {
  poll();
  do_work();
}
```

### While Loop

C++ has conditional `while() {}` and `do { } while()` forms. The former tests the expression before it even runs while the latter runs at least once before testing the expression.

```cpp
while (!end) {
  std::string next = getLine();
  end = next == "END";
}
```

The do-while form in C++ will execute the loop body at least once because the condition is only tested after each iteration instead of before.

```cpp
int i = 0;
do {
  i = rand();
} while (i < 20);
```

### Break and Continue

If you need to exit a loop or start the next iteration early then you use the `break` and `continue` keywords. The break keyword terminates the loop, the continue, causes the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

```cpp
bool foundAdministrator = false;
for (int i = 0; i < loginCredentials; ++i) {
   const LoginCredentials credentials = fetchLoginAt(i);
   if (credentials.disabled) {
     // This user login is disabled so skip it
     continue;
   }
   if (credentials .isAdmin) {
     // This user is an administrator so no need to search rest of list
     foundAdministrator = true;
     break;
   }
   // ...   
}
```

## Rust

### For loop

Rust's `for` loop is actually sugar over the top of iterators. If a structured type implements the trait `IntoIterator` it can be looped over using a `for` loop.

Basically in pseudo code, the loop desugars to this:

```pseudocode
If structure type can be turned `IntoIterator`
  Loop
   If let Some(item) = iterator.next() {
     do_action_to_item(item)
   Else
     break;
  End
Else 
  Compile Error
Done
```

#### Iterating a range

A `Range` object in Rust is expressed as `from..to` where `from` and `to` are values or expressions that evaluate to values.

For example:

```rust
let range=0..33;
// Variables
let min = 0;
let max = 100;
let range2 = min..max;
```

A range is inclusive / exclusive, i.e. the minimum value is included in the `Range` but the maximum value is exclusive.

Here is a simple loop that counts from 0 to 9

```rust
for i in 0..10 {
  println!("Number {}", i);
}
```

The value `0..10` is a `Range` that runs from 0 to exclusive of 10. A range implements the `Iterator` trait so the for loop advances one element at a time until it reaches the end.

Iterators have a lot of functions on them for doing fancy stuff, but one which is useful in loops is the `enumerate()` function. This transforms the iterator into returning a tuple containing the index and the value instead of just the value.

So for example:

```rust
for (i, x) in (30..50).enumerate() {
   println!("Index {} is value {}", i, x);
}
```

### For loop - Iterating arrays and collections

Here is a loop that iterates an array:

```rust
let values = [2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 33, 111];
for v in &values {
   println!("v = {}", v);
}
```

Note you can only iterate over an array by reference because iterating it by value would be destructive. 

We can directly use the `iter()` function that arrays and collections implement which works by reference:

```rust
let values = vec![2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 33, 111];
for v in values.iter() {
   println!("v = {}", v);
}
```

If the collection is a map, then iterators will return a key and value tuple

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut values = HashMap::new();
values.insert("hello", "world");
//...
for (k, v) in &values {
  println!("key = {}, value = {}", k, v);
}
```

Another way to iterate is using the `for_each()` function on the iterator itself:

```rust
let values = [2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 33, 111];
values.iter().for_each(|v| println!("v = {}", v));
```

### Break and Continue

Rust also has `break` and `continue` keywords and they operate in a similar fashion - they operate on the innermost loop. A `continue` will start on the next iteration while a `break` will terminate the loop.

```rust
let values = vec![2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 33, 111];
for v in &values {
  if *v % 2 == 0 {
    continue;
  }
  if *v > 20 {
    break;
  }
  println!("v = {}", v);
} 
```

#### Labels

The `break` and `continue` work by default on the current loop. There will be occasions where you intend to break out
of an enclosing loop instead. For those occasions you can label your loops and pass that label into the `break` or `continue:

```rust
'x: for x in 0..10 {
  'y: for y in 0..10 {
     if x == 5 && y == 5 {
       break 'x;
     }
     println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);
  }
}
```

### Infinite Loop

Rust has an explicit infinite `loop` that runs indefinitely:

```rust
loop {
  poll();
  do_work();
}
```

Rust recommends using this form when an infinite loop is required to assist with code generation. Note that an 
infinite loop can still be broken out of using a `break` statement.

### While Loop

A `while` loop in Rust looks pretty similar to one written in C/C++. The main difference is that parentheses are not necessary around the conditional test.

```rust
while request_count < 1024 {
  process_request();
  request_count = request_count + 1;
}
```

Rust has no equivalent to the do-while loop form. It can be simulated but it looks a bit inelegant:

```rust
let mut i = 0;
loop {
  i = i + 1;
  if i >= 20 { break; }
}
```

### While let loop

Just as there is an `if let` which tests and assigns a value that matches a pattern, there is also a `while let` equivalent:

```rust
let mut iterator = vec.into_iter();
while let Some(value) = iterator.next() {
  process(value);
}
```

This loop will break when the iterator returns `None`.
